Setting up and playing my game:

Not much testing was done in single player so I focused on multiplayer for the mod.

You can swap between the Sunlight Straight Sword (sword model) and Blacksmith Great Hammer (grenade model) by pressing 1. 

Estoc is in place of Shotgun - bushido model
Spear is in place of Rocket Launcher - kuni model
Uchigatana is in place of grenades - grenade model
Great Scythe is in place of Chaingun - grenade model

Longbow is in place of Machinegun - machine gun model
Crossbow is in place of Grenade Launcher - grenade launcher model

Parrying Dagger is in place of Hyper Blaster - karen model

Please use the following in Quake 2 console:

bind mouse2 "block"
bind q "dodgeleft"
bind e "dodgeright"
bind MWHEELUP "dodgeup"
bind MWHEELDOWN "dodgedown"
